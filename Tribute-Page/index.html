                        The Doom Marine was originally a human from Earth who served in the Marines and was dishonorably discharged due to assaulting his commanding officer after refusing to fire upon a crowd of unarmed civilians, and was later transferred to the UAC Phobos base as security. The Marine soon found himself trying to prevent the demons of Hell from invading Earth. After having fought demonic hordes through Phobos, Deimos and Hell, he returned home to find Earth overrun by demons and his wife, child, and pet rabbit Daisy, among the billions of people killed, giving him further reason to pursue hunting the demons. He continued fighting the horde on Earth, before taking the fight to Hell once more.

                        Following this, the Marine was decommissioned. Some years later though, he was called upon again to fight the hellish force attacking a space station[8], prompting him to return to Hell where he defeated the Mother of All Demons. In order to save Earth, he decided to close the portal from inside Hell and continue the fight against the demons.

                        The Mother's sister, Resurrector, wanted vengeance, thus teleported him to Earth to kill him there. But he fought his way to Hell again, and defeated her there. Once more, chose to remain in Hell to fend off the demons.
